\hypertarget{epidemiology-of-the-outcome}{%
\subsubsection{Epidemiology of the
outcome}\label{epidemiology-of-the-outcome}}

The NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute defines high
cholesterol as having total blood cholesterol (TC) levels greater than
or equal to 200 mg/dL {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-nhlbi2001}{1}{]}. More
than one third of the United States adult population has high
cholesterol and therefore are at a heightened risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and stroke {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-virani2021}{2}{]}.
Established risk factors of high cholesterol include obesity, lack of
physical activity, diet high in saturated and trans fat, type 2
diabetes, smoking, age, gender, and family history of high cholesterol
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cdc2020}{3}{]}.

According to the American Heart Association's Heart Disease and Stroke
Statistics---2021 Update, adults aged 20 and older in 2015-2018 had a
mean TC of 190.6 mg/dL {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-virani2021}{2}{]}. This
was not within the Healthy People 2020 target goal of 177.9 mg/dL. It
was also estimated that 93.9 million, or 38.1\%, of U.S. adults had
greater than 200 mg/dL TC. For TC greater than 240 mg/dL the estimated
affected adults were 28 million, or 11.5\%. Although the prevalence of
high TC in adults had decreased from 18.3\% in 2000 to 10.5\% in 2018,
the report states that the decline is likely due to greater uptake of
medications rather than changes in lifestyle. The estimated economic
burden of managing and preventing high cholesterol in the U.S. is
between \$18.5 million and \$77 million every year. The estimated burden
of CVD, an outcome of having high cholesterol, is \$219 billion
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ferrara2021}{4}{]}.

\hypertarget{epidemiology-of-the-exposure}{%
\subsubsection{Epidemiology of the
exposure}\label{epidemiology-of-the-exposure}}

During 2019 in the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported
full-time employees spent an average of 8.78 hours per workday on work
or work-related activities. This becomes 43.9 hours throughout a 5-day
workweek. Globally, 36.1\% of workers exceed 48 hours each week
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rivera2020}{5}{]}. These numbers surpass many
developed countries' standards and recommendations. The Australian
government mandates employers must not work their employees over 38
hours per week without reason. The European Union states that employers
ensure their workers do not exceed an average of 48 hours per week
including overtime. The U.S. Fair Labor and Standards Act
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-flsa1938}{6}{]} requires overtime pay after 40
hours in a week for nonexempt employees, and there is no maximum number
of hours.

When defining long working hours in research, prior studies have used
various cut points such as \textgreater40 per week
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rivera2020}{5}{]}, \textgreater80 hours per
week {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee2016}{7}{]}, and \textgreater11 hours
per day {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-lemke2017}{8}{]}. According to the
U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ppaca2010}{9}{]}, employees working at least
30 hours per week on average are considered full-time. Working long
hours leaves less time for reaching the CDC's guidelines of recommended
exercise, diet, and sleep
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-artazcoz2009}{10}{]}. It also can expose
individuals to greater amounts of work strain and psychological stress.
These experiences have been shown to increase other biomarkers such as
blood pressure and heart rate instability
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivimaki2018}{11}{]}.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\subsubsection{Literature review}\label{literature-review}}

In 1999 a study examined blood cholesterol of engineers in Japan working
in machinery manufacturing {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-sasaki1999}{12}{]}.
No significant differences were directly shown between the weekly
working hours of \textless57, 57-63, and \textgreater63. They did note
though that a stratification by age resulted with an interaction for the
age group of 30-39, but not the age group of 20-29. The group with 57-63
work hours had a higher mean TC than the other two groups.

A survey of random working adults in France described that exposure to
long working hours, defined as +10-hour days in at least 50 days out of
the year, was associated with adverse lipid levels in men
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-virtanen2019}{13}{]}. Their results were not
significant for women.

In a meta-analysis of long working hours, coronary heart disease, and
stroke resulted with a 27\% increased risk of stroke in working 49-54
hours per week compared to 36-40 hours
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivimaki2015}{14}{]}. The risk of those
working more than 55 hours was 33\% greater.

Researchers examining data from the Korean NHANES data showed 1.76 times
higher odds of coronary heart disease for men and 1.63 times higher odds
for women working \textgreater80 hours per week compared to those
working 40 hours per week {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee2016}{7}{]}. The
risk of stroke in these two working groups for men was insignificant,
but women working \textgreater80 hours had 2.32 times higher odds of
stroke than women working 40 hours.

A cross-sectional study of U.S. truck drivers was performed to explore
an effect of long working hours and blood cholesterol measurements
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-lemke2017}{8}{]}. The study population had a
mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 113.66 mg/dL. When
designing a linear regression model, working greater than 11 hours per
day significantly increased the estimated LDL-C 14.24 mg/dL.

22-year-old Australians from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort
Study examined the effect of long working hours on blood cholesterol
measurements {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-reynolds2018}{15}{]}. There were
no significant results of TC or LDL-C, but high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) was lower in those working \textgreater38 hours
compared to those working 38 hours or less.

\hypertarget{gaps-in-the-literature}{%
\subsubsection{Gaps in the literature}\label{gaps-in-the-literature}}

Most prior studies of long working hours used CHD or stroke as the
outcome rather than blood cholesterol measurements. Of the studies that
did examine blood cholesterol they were either not done in the United
States, had very high cut points for defining long hours, or did not
describe comparisons in risk or odds.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsubsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

U.S. adults spend an average of 8.78 hours per workday on work-related
activities, exceeding the standardized 40-hour workweek and reducing
available time for healthy behaviors such as sleep and exercise, and
increasing exposure to job-related stress. During 2013-2016 U.S. adults
had a mean TC of 190.6 mg/dL, which is above the Healthy People 2020
goal of 177.9 mg/dL. 93.9 million adults (38.1\%) had a TC of 200 mg/dL
or greater. 28 million adults (11.5\%) had a TC of 240 mg/dL or greater.
High cholesterol is estimated to burden the U.S. with a cost between
\$18.5 million and \$77 million each year. CVD, a result of having high
cholesterol, is estimated to cost the U.S. \$219 billion dollars.

Prior research has examined long working hours and its association with
blood cholesterol levels but they either studied populations outside of
the U.S. or had very high cut points for working hours. This analysis is
unique in that it studies a random selection of U.S. adults and lowers
the cut points in order to produce results more closely related to the
general U.S. adult population.

\hypertarget{research-question}{%
\subsubsection{Research question}\label{research-question}}

Is greater number of hours worked in the prior week associated with
subsequent high total blood cholesterol among adults aged 18-80 in the
United States, using NHANES 2017-2018 participant data? \textbf{H0:}
There is not an association between greater working hours in the past
week and high total blood cholesterol. \textbf{H1:} There is a
significant positive association between greater working hours in the
past week and high total blood cholesterol.
